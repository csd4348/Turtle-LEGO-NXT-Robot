# Turtle-LEGO-NXT-Robot

The idea of Turtle LEGO NXT Robot :
  A "turtle" that will move in space and react to the environment around it. Specifically, the "turtle" will move when the environment around it is poorly lit (lights off) and the LED light will turn on. When the environment around it is sufficiently lit (open lights - use light sensor) the turtle will stop moving. In addition, with the use of the sound sensor, when the "turtle" hears a loud noise, it will collect its "head" in its "shell". Feedback messages or animations may be printed on the screen of the NXT controller depending on the action performed by the turtle.
